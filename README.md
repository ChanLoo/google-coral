| Got a Coral dev board. What do I do? | There's an official [Getting Started Guide][1]. |
| Can't get something working. | The [issue tracker][0] is where we talk through problems. |

# Overview

Officially, Google Coral is two devices:
```
Dev Board
A single-board computer with a removable system-on-module (SOM) featuring the Edge TPU.
*    Supported OS: Mendel Linux (derivative of Debian)
*    Supported Framework: TensorFlow Lite
*    Languages: Python (C++ coming soon)
```
and
```
USB Accelerator
A USB accessory featuring the Edge TPU that brings ML inferencing to existing systems.
*    Supported OS: Debian Linux
*    Compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
*    Supported Framework: TensorFlow Lite
```

These devices are brand-spanking new, and as of right now there is very little supporting documentation. This repo exists to help interested devs avoid the twisted hellscape that is Google Product Forums.

# Dev Board
## OS notes
* Given the observations below (primarily the `libc` version) the OS appears to be an upgraded-to-testing version of Debian 9.0 (Stretch). This knowledge allows us to access Debian sources without much concern.
